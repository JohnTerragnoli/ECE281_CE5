#**Task 1**
The purpose of this task was to initialize the registers $S0 and $S1 with the decimal values 44 and -37 respectively.  To add and store the result in $S2.  Then, this value at $S2 will be stored at the hexadecimal memory address x54.  The MIPS code below performs the desired actions: 


Task 1 Code: 
```
addi $S0, $0, 44
addi $S1, $0, -37
add $S2, $0, $1
sw $S2, 0x54($0)
```



#**Task 2** 

For this portion of the computer exereise the instructions made in task 1 were hand assembled.  The machine code was then written in hexidecimal.  This process can be seen below: 

Task 2 Code:

Assembly Code:
```
addi $S0, $0, 44
addi $S1, $0, -37
add $S2, $0, $1
sw $S2, 0x54($0)
```

Converted to Binary:
